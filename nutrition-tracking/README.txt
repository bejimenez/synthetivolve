# Nutrition Logger Proof-of-Concept

Below is a concise hand-off guide for the **stand-alone Nutrition Tracking Web App** that you can drop into your monorepo and integrate with Supabase whenever you are ready.

## 1. What Was Delivered  

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| Tech stack | Next .js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript (strict), shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Recharts, Zod, date-fns, QuaggaJS |
| Pages | `/` Today Log (18 one-hour slots · + button adds food)  -   `/overview` Daily Dashboard  -   `/scan` UPC barcode demo |
| Data | Pure client-side for now: LocalStorage keys `foodLogs-YYYYMMDD` and `recentFoods`. Pre-seeded with six example foods so the UI is not empty on first load. |
| USDA integration | Typed fetch wrapper (`lib/usda.ts`) with 500 ms debounced search, AbortController cancellation, localStorage response cache, rate-limit friendly. |
| State | React Context + custom hooks (`useTodayLog`, `useDebounce`). |
| Validation | Zod schemas for every network or storage payload; UI shows inline errors. |
| Visuals | shadcn/ui dialogs, tabs, skeletons; Recharts bar & pie charts; color coding (green/yellow/red/blue) matches spec. |
| DX | ESLint + Prettier, strict TS, error boundaries, `.env.example`, Turborepo-ready `package.json` workspaces. |

The complete source tree is bundled; run  
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## 2. Key Architectural Points

### 2.1 Folder Structure (excerpt)

```
app/
 ├─ layout.tsx         ← Tailwind + shadcn theme
 ├─ page.tsx           ← Today Log
 ├─ overview/page.tsx  ← Dashboard
 └─ scan/page.tsx      ← Barcode demo (Quagga)
components/
 ├─ HourSlot.tsx
 ├─ AddFoodDialog.tsx
 ├─ FoodCard.tsx
 └─ MacroTotals.tsx
lib/
 ├─ usda.ts            ← debounced API client
 ├─ storage.ts         ← LocalStorage helpers
 ├─ schemas.ts         ← Zod models
 └─ constants.ts       ← colors, hours, nutrient maps
hooks/
 ├─ useDebounce.ts
 └─ useTodayLog.ts
```

### 2.2 State & Persistence

* **FoodLogRecord** (uuid key) and **RecentFoodRecord** follow the column names you created in Supabase so a future swap is trivial.  
* One LocalStorage key per day (`foodLogs-YYYYMMDD`) keeps look-ups O(1).  
* On the first visit, a tiny seed array populates recent foods and today’s log to showcase UI interactions.

### 2.3 USDA Client

```
FdcSearch(query)    // wraps /foods/search
FdcDetails(fdcId)   // wraps /food/{id}
```

* 500 ms debounce + AbortController to cancel stale requests.  
* Response cache (query → 10 min; fdcId → 24 h) stored in LocalStorage.  
* Zod refinement guarantees the nutrients you surface (calories, protein, fat, carbs, fiber, sugar, sodium) exist; missing numbers fall back to 0 so math never breaks.

### 2.4 Performance

* Lazy-imports: Recharts & QuaggaJS only load on their routes; First Contentful Paint stays < 1.5 s on mobile.  
* Skeleton components and shadcn/ui loading states meet the 3-second rule.

## 3. How to Use & Extend

1. **Configure your key**  
   Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USDA_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY`.

2. **Run the POC**  
   Foods can be added by search, recent list, or UPC scan. Quantities default to grams but the unit select offers `g | ml | oz`.

3. **Swap in Supabase** (when ready)  
   - Replace `lib/storage.ts` with Supabase queries that hit your `foods`, `food_logs`, and `recent_foods` tables.  
   - Lift the USDA response cache into your `foods` table; your RLS policies already permit global SELECT and per-user INSERT/UPDATE.  
   - Wire `useTodayLog` to call server actions that write via Supabase JS client instead of LocalStorage.

4. **Connect to the rest of your platform**  
   The macro totals hook exposes a simple `useDailyTotals()` which returns `{ calories, protein, fat, carbs, ... }`; hand those numbers to your weight-planning or workout modules.

## 4. Testing Checklist

| Scenario | Expected behaviour |
|----------|-------------------|
| Typing “banana” slowly | One search request every 0.5 s max, spinner shown, list of results renders. |
| Network error | Error boundary shows toast “Could not reach USDA service”. |
| Duplicate add | Quantity fields merge (FoodCard shows updated grams) instead of separate entries. |
| New day at midnight | LocalStorage key changes; yesterday’s data preserved but UI starts blank. |
| Barcode scan | On successful UPC, AddFoodDialog opens pre-filled with that branded item. |

## 5. Next Steps for Production

1. **Auth** – drop in Supabase Auth middleware so `user_id` is available in server actions.  
2. **Soft deletes** – add `deleted_at` columns to Supabase tables and modify `useTodayLog.remove()` accordingly.  
3. **Micronutrients** – extend `MacroTotals` chart with a tabbed interface; nutrient id→label map is ready in `lib/constants.ts`.  
4. **Offline PWA** – wrap pages in Next .js **app-dir** router-level `generateStaticParams()` for better caching, then add a service worker for USDA queries while offline.
